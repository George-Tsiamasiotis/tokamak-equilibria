# tokamak-equilibria

Representations of a [`Tokamak`] equilibrium consisting of a magnetic and electric field
profile, and a q-factor profile, for use in scientific calculations.

The profiles can be either analytical, or reconstructed from numerical data from a [`netCDF`] 
file.

All calculated quantities are in **Normalized Units**.
